E-Waste Collection and Recycling Management System – Example
------------------------------------------------------------
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------------
Project Title: E-Waste Collection and Recycling Management System
Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
-----------------------------------------------------------
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
------------------------------
Improper disposal of electronic waste leads to environmental pollution and health hazards.
People do not know where or how to dispose of e-waste responsibly.
Manual collection methods lack tracking, transparency, and coordination between users, collection agents, and recyclers.
------------------------------------------------
3. PROPOSED SOLUTION
----------------------------
A centralized web application that connects Users, Collection Agents, Recyclers, and Admin.
Users can request e-waste pickup from their location.
Collection Agents receive pickup requests and collect e-waste.
Recyclers process the collected e-waste responsibly.
Admin monitors the entire workflow.
Each request moves through clear status updates:
Requested → Collected → Sent to Recycler → Recycled
